This plugin can be used by web developers to convert a site from nucleus CMS to WordPress.
It imports only the textual content of the site such as the entries, users and categories. 
It does not import images into the media library although they will show up on the frontend
if you move the media folder to the root WP directory. See the other text file for usage
instructions.
