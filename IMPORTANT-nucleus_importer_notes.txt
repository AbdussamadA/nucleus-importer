Nucleus import notes:
--------------------

Before beginning:
    - Login to nucleus and note down stats like item count and comment count. Open a few items and lock + protect the tab they are in
    
    - Edit wp-config.php and WP_DEBUG to true
    
    - Edit wp-config.php to reflect nucleus database's charset. Use "show create table <table_name>" to see charset info.
    
    - In the plugin file: optionally adjust default database details (username, password etc.) at the very top of the importer PHP class
    
    - Remember nucleus "media" folder has to be in WP root dir for images to show up.
     
After import
    
    - VERY IMPORTANT - set WP_DEBUG to false in wp-config.php
    
    - Visit settings > permalink to make it generate .htaccess file.
    
    - Check that posts have images and content.
    
    - Check that you can create/add new posts, pages and comments.
    
    - Change email address in settings > general settings.
    
    - Deactivate and delete the importer plugin.
